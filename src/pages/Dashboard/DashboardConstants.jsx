Re: Response to Notice CP2000 for Tax Year 2022
Taxpayer: John Doe
SSN: XXX-XX-1234

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing in response to your Notice CP2000 dated April 30, 2023, in which you propose changes to my 2022 federal income tax return.

After careful review of the notice and my tax records, I respectfully disagree with the proposed adjustments for the following reasons:

1. The income reported from Goldman Sachs (EIN: XX-XXXXXXX) in the amount of $5,250 was already included in my Schedule C, line 1, as part of my self-employment income.

2. The reported dividend from Vanguard Investments (EIN: XX-XXXXXXX) of $750 was for a qualified dividend reinvestment in a tax-advantaged retirement account (IRA), and thus is not subject to taxation for the tax year 2022.

I have enclosed the following documentation to support my position:
- Copy of Schedule C from my 2022 tax return showing the inclusion of the Goldman Sachs payment
- Statement from my Vanguard IRA showing the dividend reinvestment transaction
- Form 1099-DIV from Vanguard indicating the qualified dividend payment to my IRA

Based on the enclosed information, I believe no additional tax is due. I request that you please adjust your records to reflect this information and confirm that this matter has been closed.

If you need any additional information, please don't hesitate to contact me at (555) 123-4567 or via email at john.doe@email.com.

Sincerely,

John Doe`;
